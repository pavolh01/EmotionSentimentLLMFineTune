Yields on policy sensitive two-year Treasuries pared a drop to the lowest level since October. The mood in markets remains nervous after Wall Street investors tempered their bullish views due to concerns that tariffs and government spending cuts will hit US growth. There’s also an increasing view that President Donald Trump won’t intervene to support the market, while the Federal Reserve has signaled it’s in no rush to adjust interest-rate policy. “In the short-term, it remains difficult to advocate buying dips, with the bear case holding more weight,” said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone. “Growth expectations continue to slide, dragging earnings expectations lower alongside, all the while policy uncertainty clouds the outlook, and as a ‘Fed put’ remains about as elusive as one from the White House.” In the US Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%.

"Lip-Bu Tan, who is set to take over as Intel’s chief executive next week, is a veteran of the semiconductor industry who has an even longer track record as a technology investor, particularly in Chinese companies.

A former Intel board member, Tan will lead a once-venerated U.S. company that has seen its fortunes fall as the artificial-intelligence boom prompted a shift in industry demand away from its central processing chips.

Intel Names Lip-Bu Tan as Chief Executive Officer

Here are five things to know about Tan and Intel.

Semiconductor titan
Tan, 65, has risen to become a titan in the semiconductor business, receiving a top honor in 2022 from the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association.

Tan gained fame during his tenure leading Cadence Design Systems—which provides software and services to develop chips and other core technologies—from 2009 to 2021. He helped to turn around the company, focusing on what Intel said was customer-centric innovation that helped double revenue and expand margins.

“Cadence was in pretty big trouble” in 2009, Morris Chang, the chairman of chip titan Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said in a tribute to Tan in 2016. “Lip-Bu led Cadence out of the trouble.”

Walden founder
Before Cadence, Tan was widely known as a venture capitalist.

Tan, who has a master’s degree in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an M.B.A. from the University of San Francisco, founded Walden International in 1987 and focused on startups in Asia. The company’s name stemmed from Tan’s fascination with the “contrarian thinking” of American essayist Henry David Thoreau, who wrote about Walden Pond in Massachusetts, according to a 2004 article in Businessweek.

Walden was an early investor in Semiconductor Manufacturing International, eventually investing more than 0 million in the Chinese chip giant. Tan served on the board of that company and China’s Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment, and he has been a fixture at Silicon Valley events hosted by the professional group Chinese-American Semiconductor Professional Association.

He served two years on the board of SoftBank Group, whose Vision Fund has been a mammoth investor in Silicon Valley in recent years.

Walden and China
Tan’s extensive ties to China have made him the target of scrutiny from Washington. Walden has backed Chinese technology companies in critical sectors such as semiconductors and AI.

In 2023, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent a letter to Tan raising “serious concern” about Walden’s investments in semiconductor, quantum-computing and artificial-intelligence companies in China, including some that the Commerce Department has blacklisted for involvement in human-rights abuses or Chinese military uses. A report from the same committee found that Walden’s internal documents cited the Chinese government’s prioritization of semiconductors as a reason to invest in the sector.

A Wall Street Journal report in 2021 found that Walden made at least 25 investments in Chinese chip companies from 2017-20, accounting for more than 40% of the Chinese semiconductor deals involving U.S. venture investors during that period.

Intel breakup?
The chipmaker’s shares rose by more than 10% in after-hours trading Wednesday. While Intel’s shares have languished in the last 12 months, its performance has been propped up by investor speculation that it could break up its manufacturing and product businesses.

The Journal reported last month that TSMC and Broadcom had preliminary discussions about deals, with TSMC having an interest in controlling Intel’s chip plants. Intel executives said they would create a separate board for the manufacturing business, a move some analysts saw as having the potential to lead to a breakup.

“The key question is whether Lip-Bu will keep product and foundry business together or go for a split,” Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri said.

Broadcom’s CEO said this week that he wasn’t currently pursuing any acquisitions.

California ties
“There’s nothing I dislike more than losing,” Tan said Wednesday in a message to employees, noting that he learned as an athlete in college to trust his teammates.

Born in what is now Malaysia and raised in Singapore, he has served on a number of community and other boards in California, including the University of California, San Francisco Health System’s executive council, the Fuller Theological Seminary and at Carnegie Mellon University.

He has been an elder at the First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley and served with former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger as a “cabinet member” for Transforming the Bay With Christ, a nonprofit organization.

“I enjoy swimming, snow skiing, fly fishing, hiking, and spending time with my family and church,” Tan said in his bio at Walden Catalyst, an early-stage venture firm Tan founded.",positive,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
"As gold races to new records, Wall Street analysts have rushed to raise their price targets, with the latest call from Macquarie Group predicting the precious metal will touch ,500 in the third quarter.

"(Bloomberg) -- It was only three weeks ago that exuberance over Donald Trump’s blueprint for the economy had vaulted US stocks to a record high. Today, with concern mounting over the goals and impact of his trade war, the S&P 500 tumbled into its first 10% correction in almost two years.Volatility surged anew across US asset classes Thursday, extending a retreat from risk that has lopped  trillion from the US equity benchmark and shows signs of seeping into high-yield bonds. New salvos in President Trump’s tariff offensive spurred another race for havens in the Treasury market.

The S&P 500 — perched at a record as recently as Feb. 19 — slid to a six-month low. This year’s selloff in the megacaps deepened, amplifying the moves. And speculative corners on Wall Street from unprofitable tech to the most-shorted shares got crushed. An  billion exchange-traded fund tracking junk bonds saw one of its biggest losses in 2025, bucking the rise in Treasuries.

In another sign of a trade-war escalation, Trump threatened to enact a 200% tariff on European wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages. Later Thursday, Trump said he would not repeal tariffs on steel and aluminum that took effect this week, nor back off plans for sweeping reciprocal tariffs on global trading parters set to start as soon as April 2.

“In only a few weeks, the broader market has gone from record highs to correction territory,” said Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial. “Tariff uncertainty has captured most of the blame for the selling pressure and is exacerbating economic growth concerns.”

Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discounted risks of a US recession, and played down the current selloff in equities, advising investors against overreacting to President Trump’s aggressive trade tactics.

“We came in with the market being fully priced, so I think a 5% to 10% correction on the S&P or the Nasdaq actually makes sense,” Mnuchin said in an interview with Bloomberg’s Saleha Mohsin Thursday.The S&P 500 fell 1.4%. The Nasdaq 100 slid 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3%. A gauge of tech megacaps lost 2.5%. Adobe Inc. sank on a disappointing outlook, while Intel Corp. surged after naming an industry veteran as its next chief.

The yield on 10-year Treasuries fellfive basis points to 4.26%. A 2 billion US sale of 30-year bonds was weak. The dollar rose 0.1%.

US Shutdown Odds Increase as Democrats Dig In Against GOP Bill

“After the election, we framed the likely impact of economic policies from Donald Trump’s second presidential administration as a mix of vegetables and dessert,” said Libby Cantrill and Allison Boxer at Pacific Investment Management Co. “Some policies could leave a bitter taste for the economy and markets – i.e., the vegetables – while others would support growth, the so-called dessert.”

“The net economic impact of the Trump administration’s second term will likely depend on the sequencing, scope, and mix of all of these policies, with risks to both the upside and downside,” they added.

Trump used markets as a litmus test for the success of his first administration, and relished in the gains posted after his victory in November.

But the stark shift from economic optimism is creating an unsettling reality for traders trying to figure out where America’s markets go from here. One major question: At a time when it’s easier than ever for people to see fluctuations in their day-to-day net worth, can a stock rout take the US economy down with it?

“Clearly this is going to be a much more volatile year and it remains to be seen if all of the revolutionary changes to the economy and trans-Atlantic alliances will lead to a recession or if it will lead to higher growth rates in the future,” said Chris Zaccarelli at Northlight Asset Management. “In the meantime, a more cautious and risk-off posture is warranted.”

“There are immediate and looming questions about how much more pain the equity market might endure,” said Michael Purves at Tallbacken Capital Advisors. “Do we buy this dip (down 10% from the peak)? Or do we sell into relief rallies such as we had yesterday?”

In a note, he highlights that there are various “technical bearish signals” that are converging in the same manner as they did in the first quarter of 2022.

“These are just technical signals, and the market risks and macro backdrop today are very different from what they were in 2022,” he said. “However, in a market environment that lacks clarity, these technical signals take on a greater prominence.”

As a reminder, Purves notes, the 2022 bear market was driven entirely by P/E contraction, not falling earnings.

“Prospectively, the market needs to figure out two things: (1) will valuation need to be re-rated to a lower range to account for policy/economic/inflation uncertainty, and (2) will earnings start falling?” he said. “If we get a concurrence of falling earnings and P/E re-rate, then the probability of the SPX selling off to 4,800 will become much higher.”

“Market fears remain at the forefront,” said Bespoke Investment Group strategists. “Investor sentiment also remains very weak.”

Bespoke cited the latest weekly poll from the American Association of Individual Investors, which showed that bearish sentiment was above 55% for the third straight week. The only other time since 1987 that bearish sentiment was above the ‘speed limit’ was in the three weeks ending March 4, 2009, the Bespoke strategists noted.

The flip side of souring sentiment is that it could be a contrarian indicator for markets, noted Jeff Schulze at ClearBridge Investments.

“Surging policy uncertainty has dented consumer and investor sentiment, raised inflation expectations and stalled the equity market rally, he said. “Should policy uncertainty ebb in the coming months, we believe risk assets will rebound.”

While the sharp drop in equity markets has been painful, Turnquist at LPL Financial says the downside rate of change and current drawdown is nothing out of the ordinary.”

Since 1950, 92% of trading days are accompanied by some degree of a drawdown on the S&P 500 (roughly 8% of days have been record highs), he said. A selloff inside of 5% is the most common, occurring in around 40% of all trading days.

“Swift drawdowns also create oversold conditions, and we are beginning to see signs of the broader market reaching washed-out territory,” he said. “However, the damage to longer-term breadth, lack of institutional participation, and defensive rotational pressures leave us cautious on buying the dip right now.”

Ed Yardeni of eponymous firm Yardeni Research has lowered his year-end estimate on the S&P 500, with the best-case target cut to 6,400 from 7,000. The worst-case goal stands at 5,800.

“We continue to bet on the resilience of the economy. However, we acknowledge that it is being severely stress-tested now by Trump 2.0’s tariff turmoil and shotgun approach to paring the federal workforce,” he said.

Earlier in March, Yardeni raised the probability of a US recession this year to 35% from 20%.

US equities are pricing in a recession risk much bigger than credit markets, leaving room for a positive surprise, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and Mika Inkinen wrote in a note.

“While there is clearly elevated uncertainty in the near term as the Trump Administration has at least initially prioritized more disruptive polices, the risk is that credit markets are proven right,” they said.

“The Treasury market is flirting with recession signals, helping amplify the risk-off sentiment in equities, while at the same time sending an alternative message of relative calm with relatively tight credit spreads,” according to Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper at Bloomberg Intelligence.

Notably, the Federal Reserve’s Treasury-based recession model flagged year-ahead recession risk a year ago, and may be proven right if tariff uncertainty continues to hamper economic activity, they said. Historically, a model reading exceeding 30% has accurately predicted recession one year out. And the current probability is 29.76%.

“The credit model’s implied probability continues to hint at a much calmer economic climate,” they noted. The indicator’s probability for recession was above 10% for most of the past two years and now sits at 13% — still just shy of suggesting a recession is in the cards.”",positive,positive,negative,negative,neutral

"The stock sell-off resumed Thursday after a mild respite in the prior session. Major indexes traded lower as Trump threatened more tariffs on imports from Europe. The tariff noise drowned otherwise upbeat news of back-to-back tame inflation reports. The market got two surprisingly tame inflation readings this week, but the upbeat data is getting drowned out by more trade war noise from the White House on Thursday. Stocks slid a day after investors got a mild boost from a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation report on Wednesday. Wholesale inflation was also less than expected, with the producer price index flat in February compared to expectations for it to increase. But, Trump keeps escalating his trade war, with the president rattling markets again on Thursday with a post on Truth Social that said he would slap a 200% tariff on all wines, champagne, and other alcohol imports from the EU if the bloc didn't repeal a 50% tariff on US whisky exports. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated the administration's position that it is willing to tolerate market volatility as it pursues policies meant to boost the broader economy. We're focused on the real economy. Can we create an environment where there are long-term gains in the market and long-term gains for the American people? Bessent said on CNBC. I'm not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks. All three major indexes traded lower on Thursday. Long-dated bond yields also climbed higher. Here's where indexes stood around 10:30 a.m. ET: S&P 500: 5,584.66, down 0.26% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 41,269.28, down 0.06% (-81.65 points) Nasdaq composite: 17,521.12, down 0.71% 10-year US Treasury yield: 4.335% (+1 basis point) While Trump's new tariff target is a relatively small portion of all EU imports, it's another sign of a spiraling trade war for investors, who just endured a  trillion sell-off in stocks as Trump pushed ahead with his latest round of tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. The news was enough for stock traders to brush off the latest PPI reading, which showed that producer prices remained flat in February, down from the 0.3% growth that economists were expecting. The figures came out after CPI showed that consumer prices rose a less-than-expected 2.8% year-over-year in February.The economy entered 2025 with a downward inflation trajectory. However, the outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations, and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now, Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, said in a note. Traders may also be discounting the cool inflation data as tariffs, which economists have warned could stoke higher prices, haven't yet impacted inflation numbers yet, according to Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. Clearly this is going to be a much more volatile year and it remains to be seen if all of the revolutionary changes to the economy and trans-Atlantic alliances will lead to a recession or if it will lead to higher growth rates in the future, but in the meantime a more cautious and risk-off posture is warranted, Zaccarelli said in a note on Thursday.",negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
"NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market has just dropped 10% from its high set last month, hurt by worries about the economy and a global trade war. The fall for the S&P 500 is steep enough that Wall Street has a name for it: a “correction.” Such drops have happened regularly for more than a century, and market pros often view them as potentially healthy wipeouts of overdone euphoria, which could send stock prices too high if unchecked. But corrections are frightening in the moment, particularly for every new generation of investors that gets into the market at a time when it seems like stocks only go up. The S&P 500 is coming off two straight years with gains of more than 20%. Such stellar gains left the market looking too expensive to critics, who pointed to how prices rose faster than corporate profits. Culling too-high enthusiasm among day traders is one thing. The larger fear always accompanying a correction is that it could be a warning sign of a coming bear market, which is what Wall Street calls a drop of at least 20%. Here’s a look at what history shows about past corrections, and what market watchers are expecting going forward. What's behind this correction? The U.S. stock market initially jumped after President Donald Trump's election in November on hopes he'd bring lower taxes, less regulation for businesses and other policies that would drive corporate profits higher. All those gains have since disappeared, as Wall Street faces the potential downsides of Trump's White House for the economy. The president has been making announcements on tariffs at a dizzying pace, first placing them on trading partners, then exempting some and then doing it all over again. The tariffs could hit every country that trades with the United States, which would raise prices for U.S. households and businesses when high inflation has already proven stubborn to fully subdue. The fear is that tariffs could slow or even halt the solid growth the U.S. economy was showing when it ended 2024. Even if Trump ultimately goes forward with less painful tariffs, all the uncertainty around the will-he-or-won't-he rollout could prove damaging by freezing economic activity. Such concerns have shown up in the latest readings on consumer confidence, as well as companies' forecasts for future profits. Trump himself has acknowledged his plans could affect the U.S. economy's growth. All the uncertainty is also making things more complicated for the Federal Reserve, which had been cutting interest rates after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Cutting rates further would help the economy, but it could also put upward pressure on inflation. The brunt of this sell-off has also hit stocks that critics were saying looked the most expensive after running wild through the frenzy around artificial intelligence. Nvidia, for example, has already dropped roughly 14% in 2025 so far after surging more than 800% through 2023 and 2024. Most of the other big stocks in the “Magnificent Seven” that have dominated the market recently have also been lagging the rest of the S&P 500. Those seven stocks alone had accounted for more than half the S&P 500’s total return last year. How often do corrections occur? Every couple years, on average. Even during the historic, nearly 11-year-long bull run for U.S. stocks from March 2009 to February 2020, the S&P 500 stumbled to five corrections, according to CFRA. Worries about everything from interest rates to trade wars to a European debt crisis caused the pullbacks. The U.S. market's last correction was in 2023, when the S&P 500 dropped 10.3% from the end of July into October. At the time, high Treasury yields were undercutting stock prices as traders accepted a new normal where the Fed would keep rates high for a while. But stocks would quickly turn higher as optimism revived that cuts to rates were on the horizon. The last correction that did graduate into a bear market was in 2022. That's when the Fed first began cranking up interest rates to combat the worst inflation in generations. Worries rose that high rates would slow the economy enough to create a recession, one that ultimately never came. Through the 2022 bear market, the S&P 500 fell 25.4% from Jan. 3 to Oct. 12. What typically happens after a drop like this? Looking only at corrections since 1946 that managed to right themselves before turning into a bear market, the S&P 500 has taken an average of 133 days to hit bottom and lost an average of nearly 14% along the way, according to CFRA. The index has taken an average of 113 days to recoup its losses. For declines that become bear markets, the damage is much worse. Going back to 1929, the average bear market has taken an average of nearly 19 months to hit bottom and caused a loss of 38.5% for the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. How bad can a bear market be? On paper, an investor can lose most of their money. From late 1929 into the middle of 1932, the stock market fell a little more than 86%, for example. A bear market can also feel interminable: One lasted more than five years, from 1937 into 1942, where U.S. stocks lost 60%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. In Japan, after the Nikkei 225 index set a record at the end of 1989, it sank and then took decades to fully recover. It wasn't until 2024 that it got back to that peak. The Japanese example is an outlier, though. In almost every case, investors would have made back all their losses from a downturn for U.S. stocks if they simply held on and didn't sell. That includes the 2000 dot-com bust, the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus collapse. What should we expect this time? No one knows. Some investors on Wall Street say they expect Trump to pull back on some policies if they prove to be too damaging, while others say the uncertainty alone is creating enough pain. The economy has given signals that it's still relatively solid at the moment, including last month's jobs report, but the outlook looks cloudier than usual given all the unknowns.",negative,negative,negative,neutral,negative

He said equity markets “like Europe and to some extent China,” have emerged as compelling opportunities as US shares have fallen from record highs. The recent swoon in US stocks is a technical correction rather than the beginning of a new bear market as it’s likely to prompt policy intervention, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett.

The BofA strategist, who has preferred international equities over the US this year, recommended buying the S&P 500 at 5,300 points, a drop of a further 4% from current levels, once stock outflows accelerate, fund managers’ cash levels rise above 4% and high-yield spreads approach 400 basis points. “We say this is a correction, not a bear market in US stocks,” Hartnett wrote in a note. “Since equity bear threatens recession, fresh declines in stock prices will provoke flip in trade and monetary policy.” Congressional Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in a high-stakes game of chicken over Democrats’ insistence that a spending package include some restraints on Elon Musk’s DOGE’s cost-cutting crusade, with Republicans refusing and daring the opposition party to risk blame for a shutdown. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer dropped his threat to block a Republican spending bill, opening the way to avoid a US government shutdown. Traders are also tracking prospects for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wants to discuss a proposed ceasefire with Trump, though he warned that any truce should lead to a long-term resolution of the war. At the same time, the US is tightening sanctions on Russia by restricting payments for energy even as it pursues peace talks. Meanwhile, investors are the most bullish on Treasuries relative to stocks for at least three years, as Trump’s tariff policies threaten to end the era of US exceptionalism, the Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey showed. In Asia, consumption stocks drove Chinese shares higher on policy hopes, while banking stocks advanced as investors positioned for a possible reduction in the reserve ratio requirement, which would free up more funds for lending. CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. plunged Friday after China’s top office dealing with Hong Kong matters reposted a sharp attack on the conglomerate’s decision to appease Trump by selling its stake in Panama ports. Elsewhere, oil advanced as the US tightened sanctions and gold traded within a whisker of ,000-an-ounce.

"You may need to say goodbye to your favorite champagne and cognac.Imported wine, champagne, and other alcoholic products from the European Union are the latest targets of President Trump's tariff threats.On Thursday morning, President Trump posted on Truth Social that if the EU didn't remove a 50% tariff on whiskey, the US would place a 200% tariff on wine, champagne, and other alcoholic products. The whiskey tariff, set for April 1, is part of retaliation for the US putting a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum.If it goes into effect, the whopping 200% tariff could essentially eliminate imports of these types of products in the United States, Needham & Company analyst Gerald Pascarelli told Yahoo Finance.A company is not going to ship it on a 200% tariff, Pascarelli said. The duty also increases the likelihood that you're going to get a global trade war with collateral damage, and that's not going to be good for the sector, he added.Year to date, shares of American whiskey maker Brown-Forman  BF-B , the world's second-largest wine and spirits seller Pernod Ricard  RI.PA , and scotch and spirits maker Diageo  DEO  have dropped 8%, 11%, and 15%, respectively.A spokesperson from Brown-Forman told Yahoo Finance, We are pleased that [European Union] President von der Leyen and Trade Commissioner Šefčovič expressed a desire to negotiate with the U.S. and are hopeful the two sides will reach a constructive resolution before the tariffs take effect on April 1.The tariff conversation is bigger than Brown-Forman and our industry, and it’s evolving rapidly, the spokesperson added.Brown-Forman said it's working closely with spiritsEurope and the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. LVMH, which owns champagne brands Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot, did not immediately respond to request for comment.Pernod Ricard referred to a statement from spiritsEurope. The trade group said it's deeply alarmed by the renewed threat of tariffs on EU and US spirits — once again, as part of an entirely unrelated dispute. This cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation must end now!Spirits trade exemplifies how open markets create mutual benefits. Reimposing tariffs would be a step backward — hurting businesses, workers, and consumers on both sides, the group added.In 2018, the EU imposed a 25% tariff on American whiskey as part of retaliatory tariffs during the first Trump administration's steel and aluminum tariffs. Given this gives a sense of déjà vu, Pascarelli said the valuation of Brown-Forman shares may have already priced in the risk of tariffs.In January, Tak Niinami, the CEO of Suntory Holdings, which owns bourbon brands Jim Beam, Maker's Mark, and Basil Hayden, told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, We are preparing for that tariff from the European continent and vice versa. We've been preparing for it because that dispute has been studied well before.In the meantime, champagne and wine lovers may start stocking up.French wines and champagnes are already the most expensive in the market, Pascarelli said. The tariffs would make it prohibitively expensive for almost every consumer. ... You might see some pre-buying right now ... on fear that [the price of] some of their favorite champagne is going to go up.Meanwhile, beer maker Molson Coors  TAP  shares are up 3% year to date, as its US-based production shields it from the risk of tariffs, per Pascarelli.It's a far different story for Constellation Brands  STZ , whose shares are down 17% this year.Tariffs are certainly a headwind to Constellation Brands, he added, as roughly 86% of Constellation Brands' sales are Mexican beer. Constellation Brands imports every single drop of beer that it sells in the United States from Mexico ... that's going to impact their entire beer business.",positive,negative,negative,negative,neutral
"Key Takeaways The S&P 500 tumbled into correction on Thursday as stocks continued to sell off amid growing concerns about tariff risks. Retail investor activity suggests we're in the third of five psychological phases of a typical market downturn, according to analysts at Vanda Research. A disconnect between investor sentiment and behavior has widened in recent weeks; individual investors feel extremely bearish but have reduced their equity exposure only slightly. The political and economic uncertainty that has sent U.S. stocks reeling in recent weeks is making it difficult for investors to predict when stocks will find their footing. Retail investor activity suggests we're in the third of five psychological phases of a typical market downturn, according to analysts at Vanda Research. “Retail behavior around equity market drawdowns looks a lot like an abbreviated version of Kübler-Ross’s Five Stages of Grief model,” analysts Marco Iachini and Lucas Mantle said in a report released Thursday. The sell-off in U.S. stocks intensified on Thursday, sending the benchmark S&P 500 index into its first correction since October 2023. The recent rout has been fueled primarily by uncertainty around President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again threats to impose tariffs, which economists say could spur inflation and weigh on economic growth. The 5 Stages of Stock Market Grief The Vanda analysts break down the stages and their characteristics in the following way: Denial: Retail investors “buy the dip” as analysts argue fundamentals remain strong. Anger: Some retail investors begin to capitulate, and often blame external forces (e.g., bad Fed policy, geopolitics, algorithmic trading). Bargaining: Retail investors begin to accept the downturn, and wait to sell amid relief rallies. Funds rotate into defensive stocks. Depression: Market sentiment hits rock bottom as investors capitulate and draw comparisons to past crises. Acceptance: Volatility subsides as investors begin to reallocate to quality stocks at a discount. So Where Are We Now? Retail trading suggests we’re currently in the bargaining phase, say Iachini and Mantle. Retail investors bought a near-record .85 billion of U.S. stocks on “DeepSeek Monday,” according to Vanda Research data. They bought another .55 billion a week later when Trump first imposed tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods. These, Iachini and Mantle argue, were denial-driven “buy the dip” moments. Markets may have entered the “anger” phase in February when retail investors scaled back their buying as volatility increased amid tariff uncertainty. Vanda data suggests retail investors started selling during relief rallies in late February, a sign the “bargaining” mentality was prevailing. Concerns about slowing economic growth have encouraged a rotation into the Magnificent Seven and out of small caps, another sign investors are bargaining, not capitulating. The next phase, theoretically, is “depression,” and Iachini and Mantle say some indicators suggest we’re already there; investor sentiment has turned overwhelmingly bearish, according to a weekly American Association of Individual Investors survey. But contrary to typical depression behavior, retail investors haven’t trimmed their equity exposure all that much, according to Vanda data. Institutional investors, meanwhile, are trading like bears. Iachini and Mantle note the last time that happened—in August 2024—improving economic data and encouraging signaling from the Federal Reserve revived bullish sentiment before retail investors followed suit. “The jury is still out on whether today’s sell-off will follow a similar pattern,” they wrote. “A lack of a credible macro (growth) put will shift our focus squarely on retail flows for signs of a market bottom.",positive,negative,negative,negative,neutral
"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The S&P 500 GSPC narrowly entered correction on Thursday, meaning the benchmark index has retreated 10% from its last all-time high on Feb. 19. But whether the S&P 500 has officially reached a technical term used to describe a drawdown is perhaps really neither here nor there. The key question of course is how often sell-offs like this keep getting worse. Friday offered at least a very temporary answer to that with the S&P 500 rising more than 2.1%%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gaining 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite IXIC 2.6%. Interestingly enough, research from Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick shows that 10% corrections not only happen quite frequently but often end up being the main event instead of extending to a bear market, defined by a 20% drop from an all-time high.Detrick's work shows that since World War II, the S&P 500 has experienced 48 corrections. However, only 12 of those corrections have turned into bear markets, meaning 75% of the time, a correction doesn't spiral all the way down to a bear market. Maybe we go into a correction, but we do not see a bear market coming, Detrick told Yahoo Finance. Early in the post-election year, choppiness is normal and that's kind of what's happening. The swift nature of the recent pullback is also typically a good barometer for how the index bounces out of correction, according to BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski. In a research note on Friday, Belski highlighted that outside of the pandemic, no correction since World War II that happened as quickly as the current one has led to a bear market. These types of corrections that happen this fast go right back up and recover just as fast, if not more, Belski told Yahoo Finance. He added this makes him very comfortable with his 6,700 year-end target for the S&P 500. In terms of fundamentals, they're still flashing green, not yellow, not red, Belski said.

"Kia Americas COO says business rules like tariff strategy won't dictate where the company makes its cars.Korean automaker Kia 000270.KS, is killing it. Kia America, part of the Hyundia Motor Group, reported another record sales month in February, powered by its mix of gas powered offerings like the high-selling Telluride SUV, as well as EV vehicles like the EV6 crossover. So our grand strategy is, first, we want to be a leader in what we call sustainable mobility. This is key, is mission, and EVs are part of that, and also includes electrified internal combustion, which is hybrids and plug in hybrids and so on, Steven Center, Kia Americas COO & EVP told Yahoo Finance. But we we've also built out a very full lineup of internal combustion vehicles in the past few years. Center mentions the aforementioned three-row Telluride, as well as the Sorrento and other smaller SUVs. The company didn’t abandon sedans — like its Big Three rivals did — and just introduced the midsize K4 last year. The larger K5 is actually built in North America.A big part of the growth plans for Kia include localizing production in the US, which it has done for many years. Kia intends to move its EV production stateside as well. We're going to be building EVs in Georgia, and that's before any of this tariff talk. Kia has been in the United States for over 30 years now, and we've invested as a company, billions and billions and billions of dollars in American manufacturing and supply chain, Center said. So this is part of a plan weve had for a long time. Officially, Kia addressed the 800-pound gorilla in the room —Trumps auto tariffs — by stating the company is monitoring tariff developments and will be reviewing business strategies in response. But — and this is a big but — the White House hasn’t targeted vehicles made in South Korea, where Kia is based and still imports vehicles in the US.Ford CEO Jim Farley has been howling that not targeting other international imports with tariffs is unfair because international automakers like Kia are essentially getting a free ride, whereas imports from Mexico and Canada — also part of a free trade agreement — are slated for 25% duties starting April 2. Unfair or not, it’s likely only a matter of time before other trade partners are targeted by the administration, and Center believes Kia has a good game plan if that happens, because of its large US footprint. [Tariffs] will affect every brand differently depending on their balance of what they make where. So in our case, and weve had plenty of meetings about this in the past few months, weve got our business plan, and were going to continue to work that plan to the best advantage of our customers, our dealers — who are also customers who have big investments in Kia — and to hit the volume levels, we want to keep growing [in the US].Center added: Were not chasing business rules, were doing what we think is the right thing for Kia, and thats building as many cars as we can here. Building EVs is next on the agenda at Hyundai and Kia’s joint plant in Bryan County, Georgia. The company touts the 0.5 billion it has spent in the US on its domestic production facilities, which it says employ over 570,000 workers. At Kia’s big Kia Day event in Portugal late last month, the automaker unveiled a number of new vehicles, including the EV4, a sporty EV sedan that also comes in hatchback form. Center believes cars like the EV4 will only grow the company’s sales and not cannibalize other similar vehicles like the gas-powered K4 or larger EV6 midsize crossover; these will be net incremental volume, he says, meaning its sales will be additional sales over and above what Kia normally would get. It remains to be seen if sales aren’t cannibalized, as they have been at other manufacturers who offer similar products with differing drivetrains. On the flip side, a wide availability of powertrains may expand sales, bringing new customers to fold. Center believes Kia’s plan of offering a wide product portfolio is the right one for the US. Looking big picture, despite economic jitters coming from tariffs, and concerns of an possible ensuing economic slowdown in the US in 2025, Center and Kia see growth in the cards. So we think the market is going to be good. If there aren't too many shocks to the system, we'll we'll have another record year. We're planning for that, Center said.",positive,positive,positive,positive,neutral
"After Warren Buffett sold 34 billion in equities in 2024 and is sitting on a 34 billion cash pile, one analyst said the Oracle of Omaha saw the current selloff coming. While it's unlikely Buffett will make any big moves during the current market turmoil, some think he’ll look internationally or round out his insurance business. Amid the stock market selloff, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett’s recent capital movements suggest he was preparing for it, according to an analyst. After tumbling more than 10% from its last peak, the Nasdaq remains in correction territory. The S&P 500 also entered a correction, though Friday’s rally pared its decline to less than 10% from its all-time record. That has highlighted Berkshire’s recent cash hoarding as especially prescient. When asked if Buffett saw the selloff coming, Armando Gonzalez, founder of AI-powered research platform Bigdata.com, said the evidence suggests he did. “Buffett’s actions over the past year have been a textbook example of positioning for turbulence, he said in an emailed response to questions from Fortune. Berkshire sold 34 billion in equities in 2024, ending the year with a cash pile of 34.2 billion—nearly double from a year ago and more than its shrinking stock portfolio of 72 billion. Gonzalez also noted that Buffett’s recent comments have been riddled with caution, emphasizing inflationary concerns and geopolitical uncertainty. For example, he warned that President Donald Trump’s tariffs will cause prices to rise. History shows when Buffett turns net seller, he often anticipates a period of subpar market performance, Gonzalez said. And once again, the Oracle of Omaha seems to have been ahead of the curve. With stocks well off their highs, that begs the question: will the famously value-conscious Buffett start deploying his cash by making some big purchases? To be sure, Berkshire has made some moderate stock buys. But preferring bargains, Buffett historically looks to invest heavily in companies when valuations are low. During the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, Buffett deployed  billion into General Electric whose stock price had nosedived. In his latest letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett reiterated his years-long view that valuations remained high. Gonzalez said it’s possible Buffett could start buying but only if true bargains emerge, noting that his track record shows a deep aversion to haste, even when markets tumble. He has no interest in timing the market’s bottom, nor does he chase short-term rebounds, he said. Instead, he waits for moments when fear drives prices to levels where the risk-reward equation tilts decisively in his favor. If Buffett should choose to finally make a big purchase, Gonzalez expects his next move to be used with a scalpel rather than a broad-market splash, if any at all. In Buffett’s world, patience is more than a virtue, it's a weapon, he added. While it's uncertain if Buffett will go forward with a deal during the current market selloff, CFRA Research’s Cathy Seifert told Fortune she wouldn’t be surprised if Berkshire rounded out its insurance holdings. She added that valuations are still not dirt cheap, while the cash Buffett has parked in Treasury bonds is yielding him a good return and the competitive environment for deals has changed. Additionally, Buffett has shown keen interest in Japanese trading companies, suggesting a growing appetite for international diversification, Gonzalez said. Since 2019, Berkshire has invested in the five biggest Japanese sogo shosha, which invest across sectors domestically and abroad. The trading houses—Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo—operate “in a manner somewhat similar to Berkshire itself, Buffett wrote in his annual letter. While Buffett sits on his pile of cash, his deployable funds may grow even more as rumors of a rare Berkshire sale circle. The Wall Street Journal reported that real-estate brokerage Compass was in advanced talks to acquire Berkshire Hathaway’s HomeServices of America. According to Berkshire’s annual report, HomeServices has 820 brokerage offices and 270 franchisees in 2024. Berkshire Hathaway did not return Fortune’s request for comment.",positive,positive,neutral,neutral,neutral

"Gold made the sprint to ,3000 $ on Friday as uncertainties about the economy and an escalating trade war drove up demand for the safe-haven asset. Gold (GC=F) futures rose to hover above ,008 per ounce while spot gold reached above ,001.The precious metal was on track for a second straight week of gains amid new data indicating moderating inflation and the announcement of retaliatory tariffs from the United States' trading partners. Though it feels like a psychological threshold, gold at ,000 might just be a stepping stone if trade wars deepen, said Tony Redondo, founder of Cosmos Currency Exchange. That said, it’s not all about Trump. Central banks, interest rate bets, geopolitical tensions, and inflation concerns are all stoking the flames. Read more: How to invest in gold in 4 steps Trade tensions grew this week after President Trump threatened 200% tariffs on wine and spirit imports from Europe on Thursday. The threat followed the EU's announcement of retaliatory tariffs after the US put a 25% duty on steel and aluminum. Gold is up more than 12% year to date after making multiple record highs in recent months. All eyes are on how gold continues to play a role as a safe haven asset, said Joe Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council. With rising inflation expectations, lower rates, and continued uncertainty, we continue to see support for gold looking ahead.Wall Street has been playing catch-up by raising price targets to keep pace with gold's rise.

We are raising our gold price forecast to a 3Q25 quarter average peak of ,150 per ounce and our single point price high to ,500 per ounce, he added. Wall Street strategists have attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared.

"Republican Sen. Ted Cruz supports President Trump's use of tariffs, just not for the long term. I fully support the president using the threat of tariffs to incentivize Mexico and Canada to help secure the border. Now that being said, my home state of Texas does an enormous amount of trade with Mexico and Canada. I don't want to see the long-term economic policy being big tariffs against Mexico and Canada, Cruz told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below). And so my hope is that those policies stay as an incentive rather than an ongoing feature of economic policy.The president has paused 25% duties on Canadian and Mexican imports that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA). But Trump on Wednesday hit Canada with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, backing off a floated 50% duty. On Thursday, Trump said that if the European Union didn't remove a 50% tariff on whiskey, the US would place a 200% tariff on wine, champagne, and other alcoholic products. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Trump has implemented a second round of 10% duties on Chinese imports after instituting 10% in February. The targeted countries wasted no time hitting back. China unveiled a 15% tariff on US chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton products and an additional 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. The new tariffs from China began on Monday. Canada announced a 25% tariff on 30 billion Canadian dollars of US imports. As for Cruz, there is a lot at risk for his home state of Texas after brisk 3.9% GDP growth in 2024. Mexico has been Texas's biggest trade partner for the past 16 years. Texas's top imports from Mexico include electric machinery, sound and TV equipment, various fuels, and medical and surgical equipment. Texas houses about one-third of US refining capacity and refines crude oil imported from Canada and Mexico. Businesses in the state may already be wary of the tariff pinch. The latest Dallas Fed survey for February saw its production index — a barometer of state manufacturing conditions — plunge 21 points from January. The new orders index fell 11 points and the capacity utilization index declined 14 points. Perceptions of broader business conditions worsened in February too. It's clear in the next four years, we will see more tariffs than we had the previous four years, Cruz said. What I've urged him [the president] is two things. No. 1, focus on China. I have said for a long time that China poses the greatest geopolitical risk to the United States over the next hundred years. And so I want to see our economy delink from China. And then secondly, what I've urged the president to do is focus on reciprocity, he explained. And the virtue of reciprocity is if President Trump imposes tariffs on a foreign country and the foreign country doesn't like those tariffs, they already have a solution to that, which is lower the tariffs they're putting on US goods.Investors have reacted harshly this month to the flurry of tariff headlines. The S&P 500 (GSPC) fell 1.4% on Thursday, the 10th daily decline this year with a loss above 1% according to data from Creative Planning chief markets strategist Charlie Bilello. Last year, at this point, the S&P 500 had only three big down days, which Bilello said was abnormally low. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are each down by about 5% in March.Some of the market's often most popular stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR), have seen pullbacks of more than 10% from their 52-week highs. Wall Street recession calls have begun to creep into the picture too. Well, look, there's no doubt there has been some uncertainty, Cruz said. When I talk to business leaders, the most consistent question I get from them is what's going to happen on the tariff front? So I understand that uncertainty, and I think it'll take some time to have a clearer picture of what the exact tariff landscape is going to look like.",negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
"Some of the biggest bosses on Wall Street aren't hitting the panic button on President Trump's policies this week despite the recent gyration in markets, even as they acknowledge some new concerns from the business world. Blackstone BX CEO Steve Schwarzman said earlier this week that US tariffs will produce more manufacturing in the United States at the end of the day, and given the size of the US, that tends to be a good thing for the world. Goldman Sachs GS CEO David Solomon said Wednesday, I think the business community understands what the president is trying to do with tariffs, even if executives do want lower tariffs everywhere. BlackRock BLK CEO Larry Fink said Wednesday that while he does hear from CEOs that the economy is weakening as we speak, he predicts that if we are able to unlock private capital ... that will restart and rekindle the next wave of a bull market.Wall Street certainly has a lot riding on Trump 2.0. At the beginning of the year, bankers were wildly optimistic that the Trump administration’s pro-growth agenda and deregulatory stance would unleash the market’s animal spirits and spur a flurry of US deals. But the uncertainty surrounding the administration's trade policies is roiling markets and raising new concerns about the direction of the US economy and inflation. That is making it more challenging for bankers and executives to know how trade changes could affect their supply chains or if they should pull the trigger on a public listing or a merger. At the beginning of this week, Goldman Sachs GS became the first major Wall Street firm to lower its year-end price target for the S&P 500 GSPC, after the major index tumbled into near-correction territory and the firm reduced its outlook for GDP. Though less bullish than the major bank initially expected, the new forecast is still optimistic — it's 11% higher than the index’s all-time high set in February. Solomon said Wednesday on Fox Business Network's Mornings with Maria that he still expects a pickup in certain deals this year. The level of uncertainty is a little bit higher, and that has kept some possible transactions on the sidelines, but the overall level of dialogue, as people are thinking strategically about where they want to drive their businesses, is certainly increasing.There is potential, especially if we got more specific actions on the regulatory front, to unleash more animal spirits, he added. Trump did make an effort this week to speak directly to Solomon and some of the other top CEOs at a meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, D.C. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet There's a renewed spirit, the president told the executives, adding that the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country. During a portion of the meeting closed to the press, Trump laid out other parts of his agenda — including extending the corporate tax cuts, speeding up approvals on environmental projects, and bringing more jobs and plants back to the US, according to a person familiar with the remarks.The next day, one attendee, JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon, downplayed the effect tariffs thus far may be having on consumer sentiment. I don't think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work, which there are like 175 million of them, changes what they're going to do because they read about tariffs, Dimon said in an interview with a Semafor reporter at a Washington, D.C., event hosted by BlackRock and the Bipartisan Policy Center. But, he added, in a nod to some unease in the business world, I do think companies might. Uncertainty is not a good thing. Since Trump took office, Dimon has, in some measure, applauded the Trump administration's efforts to cut down on Washington, D.C.'s bureaucracy and publicly rebuked tariff worries without delivering an outright judgment on whether the cost-cutting efforts or trade policies have gone too far.Days into Trump's second term, Dimon said of tariffs, If it's a little inflationary, but it's good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it,while speaking with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He made similar points on March 7 during a talk at Stanford University, calling the current impact of tariffs very modestly inflationary and said the effect on that part of the economic picture was being blown out of proportion. However, he acknowledged scenarios where the impact could be bigger. Now, if you put 25% tariffs on all imports, okay, that's a lot more. That could be, in my viewpoint, recessionary and inflationary, Dimon added. Read more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you? Fink, who runs the world's largest money manager, has already shown that his company's moves can align with the priorities of the Trump administration. It came last week when a BlackRock-led coalition struck a 2.8 billion deal with Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison that included taking control of two ports located on either end of the Panama Canal.The move gave Trump what he asked for on his first day in office — a larger American presence in a crucial shipping lane where he had alleged Chinese interference. Fink himself cleared the deal with Trump and other White House officials, according to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal. This week, Fink offered optimism even amid some uncertainty. The world economies, over a long cycle, are going to be fine, Fink said Monday at an event in Houston. On Tuesday he told CNN: Could we have one quarter or two quarters of a flattening of our economy as we try to reset the economy? Absolutely. But, he added, Trump's policies, including tariffs, can be very productive for the United States in the long run. As for market losses this week, he said there’s nothing wrong with a market pullback. I look at that as a buying opportunity because I'm very bullish on America.",positive,positive,positive,positive,neutral
"SHANGHAI ((Reuters)) - China's securities watchdog will step up monitoring fake information in the stock market and work with the police and cyberspace regulators to crack down on those who disseminate false news, which is being made easier by AI, official media reported on Saturday. Regulators will hit early, hit hard, and hit at the heart of the issue, the Securities Times said. Artificial intelligence has become a new tool for creating and spreading misleading information to con investors or manipulate stocks, luring investors with the prospect of getting rich quickly, the Shanghai Securities News said in a separate article. The rise of Chinese AI company DeepSeek has driven retail investors and fund managers to embrace AI to help them evaluate companies and invest, but their adoption of the technology also raises risks they will become vulnerable to fake news created by artificial intelligence. The Securities Times said the China Securities Regulatory Commission would be more pro-active in dispelling stock market rumours by issuing clarifications and would strengthen investor education and guidance to enhance investors ability to spot fake information. The reports by the Securities Times and the Shanghai Securities News coincide with the March 15 annual World Consumer Rights Day, which has become a major television and social media event in China to promote consumer protection.",positive,neutral,negative,negative,neutral
"Though the broad outlook for corporate earnings remains strong, analysts have been steadily trimming their expectations for company results in the next 12 months. Profit forecasts for S&P 500 Index companies have seen more downgrades than upgrades for 22 of the past 23 weeks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, the longest stretch since early 2023. A darkening earnings picture would be an unwelcome development for stock investors, after worries over the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies spurred a selloff that has dragged the S&P 500 around 8% from last month’s record. With robust earnings expansion needed to justify the market’s still-elevated valuations, signs that companies may struggle to meet profit expectations in the months ahead could further sour sentiment. The earnings outlook is starting to crack, said Eric Beiley, executive managing director of wealth management at Steward Partners. This drawdown in stocks is signaling to sell-side analysts that they need to bring down their annual profit outlooks even further from here. While first quarter earnings season kicks off on April 11 with a report from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other banks, some US companies are already sending worrying signals. American Airlines Group Inc. on Tuesday predicted its first-quarter loss would be roughly twice as big as expected, a day after bellwether Delta Air Lines Inc. cut its profit outlook in half, with both carriers citing weakening demand for air travel. Retailers including Kohl’s Corp., Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and Walmart Inc. have also sounded a cautious note. Analysts still see a 10% advance in S&P 500 earnings in 2025, down from a 13% forecast in early January, BI data show. But there may be ample room on the downside: Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management, said analysts will likely need to trim their annual S&P 500 profit estimates for 2025 to the high single-digits to account for the restraint tariffs would put on corporate profit margins. There’s still the risk of estimates falling as more companies guide around Trump’s tariff policies, said Scott Chronert, head of US equity strategy at Citigroup Inc. Others have already reeled in their earnings estimates. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., on Tuesday reduced his full-year earnings growth estimate to 9% from 11%. He now sees the index ending the year at 6,200, down from a previous forecast of 6,500. That would still be a nearly 10% gain from Friday’s close. An earnings picture that grows too bleak could weigh on stocks. Evidence that investors are already bracing for more downside ahead can be seen in the record highs in gold, a popular safe haven. Prices for US government bonds, another popular destination for nervous investors, have risen since mid-February. Keith Buchanan, partner and senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, has been selling some large-cap growth shares and raising his cash allocation. It only makes sense to err on the side of caution, he said. Of course, corporate results in recent years have shown resilience in the face of everything from soaring inflation to the highest interest rates in decades. Investors hope Trump will either soften or remove tariffs before they pinch profits. It could also take months before more sell-side analysts and companies guide forecasts lower, according to Michael Casper, equity strategist at BI. Such a scenario played out during Trump’s first term: though the US trade war with China heated up in the early months of 2018, the hit to corporate profits only showed up about a year later, according to BI data. Still, Casper noted that the economy had the tailwind of big corporate tax cuts during that period. Pressure has grown on Trump to push through a sweeping tax bill in his second term, as economic worries mount. For Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer and founding partner at Ion Macro Management, earnings have not figured into the recent selloff, which he said has been driven by investors unwinding overstretched positions in US megacaps and reallocating funds to Europe and Asia. He remains optimistic on corporate profits and the longer term performance of stocks. However, if any negative earnings surprises are injected into the market, things will get more turbulent from here, he said.",positive,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
"China's stock market is suddenly surging after a tough time in 2024. A pro-tech shift from Beijing is spurring confidence in markets. While economic challenges persist, sources say the government is correcting course. China looks investible again. The country's stocks are rallying, countering the notion that investors should avoid the world's second-biggest economy. Though many on Wall Street have been bearish on China since 2023, its stock market is suddenly looking good relative to flagging US peers. Just a year ago, investors fled China in droves as they lost faith in its post-pandemic economy, and the exodus quickly back an ongoing problem for Beijing. Amid fear that China would buckle from deflation, unemployment, or its high debt environment, foreign direct investment last year hit its lowest level since 1992. The CSI 300 Index, a benchmark of mainland shares, dropped over 45% from a 2021 peak to the end of last year. But now, while US stock leaders have suffered big declines since mid-February, Chinese large-caps have achieved their best annual start since 2002. While the S&P 500 is down almost 10% from its February all-time high, the CSI 300 has topped a mid-December high and is up about 5% year-to-date. The moves are causing analysts to start paying attention. Citi recently upgraded China stocks to Overweight, while dropping its view of US stocks to Neutral. Meanwhile, Bank of America has said that the country will outperform this year, predicting that the previously unloved tech stocks will gain ground on sagging US peers. Pro-tech turnaround Before this year, many were skeptical about China's tech environment, which was weighed down by disapproval from Beijing officials. Since 2020, many of the nation's leading tech names have been caught in a regulatory crackdown, making investors hesitant to put money to work. But the government's changing approach toward the industry has been on full display in the past month, starting with President Xi Jinping's supportive remarks at a top tech symposium in February. Pro-business undertones continued in this week's two sessions, a set of concurrent policy meetings that outline the country's economic goals. Ben Harburg, founder of Core Values Alpha, cited Beijing's recent embrace of its tech sector as one of several catalysts behind his firm's upside thesis. Eighteen months ago, his company created the CoreValues Alpha Greater China Growth ETF on the idea that investors have become too pessimistic about China's economy and its tech sector. [Beijing] very clearly said: Our national growth will be driven by technology, Harburg told Business Insider. So it is unequivocal now they will lean in on technology, they will be supportive of technology, will do everything in their power to stimulate, subsidize, de-regulate — whatever is necessary to help technology kind of win. That's an alluring notion for stocks beaten down by an anti-tech narrative in recent years. As of late February, Chinese equities were trading at around a 50% discount compared to the US market. But the perceptions of China's negative view of the space might have been exagerrated, Harburg noted. I don't think the Chinese government was ever an anti-tech as we were led to believe, he said, adding: The world perceives it very differently, because [regulation] happens without any warning, and it and it kind of like just shocks people and throws them off. The crackdown narrative has given Chinese equities room to run higher this year, as it's helped lower valuations which are now moving upward. But it also helped catch US investors by surprise. Starting with China's DeepSeek tool, a flurry of competitive Chinese AI tools have debuted this year, upending confidence in America's leadership in the space and sparking a reevaluation of Beijing's market, Harburg said. As the AI trade has waned in the US this year, China's AI-linked stocks have soared on the back of the latest announcements. Clearly, China is much further along than we were told, Harburg said. An economic turnaround? There are still challenges though, and, so far, Beijing's focus on tech is only a sentiment shift, said Tianlei Huang, a researcher for the Peterson Institute for International Economics. While positive signals were given, this remains a symbolic gesture without new policies. China's private sector—including tech— continues to face the same challenges that have pushed investors away since COVID, while confidence among entrepreneurs and consumers is at post-pandemic lows The reaction in the stock market to this [tech] symposium is, I think, actually a very sad thing, he said. Nothing in substance has really changed in terms of policy, regulations, right? It's just an attitude change. Many of the broader issues that have plagued China's economy are still in play. That includes a highly indebted real-estate sector and downbeat consumers, creating a deflationary environment from which investors have fled since 2023. But Beijing might finally be waking up to this as well. Over the past year, many of its stimulus measures have fallen short as they failed to target domestic consumers, which analysts agree are the linchpin to growth. Yet, during the two sessions, there was a new-found emphasis on domestic demand and private consumption. By Friday, stocks rose as the government urged financial lenders to ease loan terms for consumer borrowers. The shift toward domestic growth comes as China realizes it cannot reach this year's 5% GDP target by depending on trade, Huang said. This was the case last year, as net exports accounted for 30% of GDP. It's not a sustainable number, and it's largely driven by product stockpiling from buyers worried about Washington's trade war. It remains to be seen whether the 5% target is realistic, Huang said, though the sentiment shift is significant and should shape future policy. But Harburg sees things in a much brighter light. Aside from the positive mood in tech, he noted that investor fears about China haven not been realized. There's been no major real-estate crash and improvements are beginning to show in first-tier cities. It doesn't happen for two years, three years, four years. And so the reality is, I think people are finally kind of fatigued with all of these stories that they were told, he said.",positive,negative,positive,neutral,neutral
"(Bloomberg) -- A rebound in stocks faded on speculation the market has run too far, too fast amid risks stemming from a trade war to an economic slowdown and sticky inflation.Following one of its best days in 2025, the S&P 500 fluctuated. Wall Street investors refrained from making big bets on Tuesday, with a slide in consumer confidence to a four-year low weighing on sentiment. That’s even as traders added to bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. Bond yields slipped. The dollar halted a four-day advance. Oil fell as US said Russia and Ukraine have agreed to a ceasefire in the Black Sea. US copper surged to a record. Subscribe to the Stock Movers Podcast on Apple, Spotify and other Podcast Platforms. Market forecasters have been split on whether the rebound in equities has further to go. Strategists at HSBC Holdings Plc led by Max Kettner downgraded their rating on US stocks to underweight, citing economic concerns. Meantime, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Ilan Benhamou said it’s time to pause the rally-fading approach as emerging clarity on tariffs alleviates some key risks. To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak, the stock market’s bounce from a selloff has been a good one, but it investors need to be convinced that the worst is really behind us. In other words, this bounce is nothing more than something you would normally see after a correction, he noted. The S&P 500 was little changed. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average wavered. Most megacaps advanced, though Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. halted their rallies. KB Home sank after cutting its sales forecast. The yield on 10-year Treasuries slid three basis points to 4.30%. The dollar dropped 0.2%. Consumer sentiment surveys from The Conference Board and University of Michigan have been dismal of late as households fear a resurgence in inflation from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Companies have warned of higher prices and less demand, coinciding with economists’ forecasts that suggest a risk of stagflation and rising odds of recession.Sentiment continues to wane among investors, consumers and businesses as economic concerns and economic policy uncertainty takes its toll, said Bret Kenwell at eToro. Until there’s more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable. At UBS Group AG, Bhanu Baweja said the visibly tiring US consumer is set to further pressure stock prices. He expects the S&P 500 to drop as low as 5,300 points as analysts cut profit estimates for the next three to four months. The gauge hovered near 5,770. Over the last several weeks we’ve seen evidence that whatever froth there was in terms of market sentiment, bullish sentiment has been wrung out, said Bespoke Investment Group strategists. They noted the latest example came in Tuesday’s consumer confidence, with the percentage of those expecting lower stock prices in the year ahead surging by more than 10 percentage points. Following these prior surges in negative sentiment, though, the equity market tended to start recovering, and pretty quickly in most cases, Bespoke said. For much of last year, market forecasters bumped up their outlooks for US equities in tandem, chasing a rally that propelled the S&P 500 from one record high to another. But a quick 10% drop from the index’s February high caught them offsides, triggering a debate over which way stocks will go next. Of course, the benchmark has bounced back in recent days as the White House signaled plans to take a more targeted approach to the tariffs coming next week. However, the ultimate outcome remains highly unpredictable since levies from the US are likely to trigger reciprocal responses from the countries they’re aimed at, making the economic consequences almost impossible to predict. The issue at this point is the risk/reward is much less favorable than when the S&P 500 was around 5,500-5,600, said Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG. So in order to be aggressive buyers here, you have to believe the S&P 500 is going back above 6,000. While we are open to that possibility, it’s not our base case.",negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
"More trouble for Tesla (TSLA) in Europe and the UK, its third biggest region, as a combination of heightened competition, a key product changeover, and CEO Elon Musk’s polarizing politics weigh on sales. Still, one of Wall Street's Tesla biggest fans remains bullish. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) reports Tesla’s registrations — a close proxy for sales — in the EU, UK, and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) fell 40.1% in February, to 16,888 EVs. Over the span of January and February, Tesla EV registrations are down 42.6% (26,619). Meanwhile, the ACEA reports total EV registrations are up for those regions, hitting 164,646 units, an increase of 26.1% compared to a year ago, and up 31.4% including January (330,584). After a big pop to start the week, Tesla stock fell in early trading on Tuesday. Europe, there was always going to be increasing competition there, RBC analyst Tom Narayan said in a live interview on Yahoo Finance this morning. (See video above) He added that there’s also heightened competition in China, Tesla’s second biggest region behind the US. But Narayan, a Tesla bull with an Outperform rating and 20 price target on the stock (though he did cut this from 40 last week), says Tesla is poised to overcome the weakness. They do have two new models — the Model Y refresh [and] the new affordable car coming, which could potentially help stem some of these losses, he said. Narayan signaled that he’s not too worried about Tesla’s EU sales, noting that Tesla is about half the total US EV market and adding that the sales data is actually higher in the US for the first two months of the year, though S&P registration data for January said Tesla’s metrics were lower.Narayan did not address the elephant in the room — Elon Musk’s tumbling popularity in both the US and Europe, where his political endorsements of far-right movements have alienated a wide swath of EV-interested buyers. With that said, Narayan’s bullish take on Tesla extends to the overall industry, where EV penetration is low, which can help all automakers, even Tesla. But remember: EVs are still relatively underpenetrated globally, so it could be a rising tide lifts all boats when it comes to car sales, Narayan said. Indeed, at least for Europe, while EV registrations were higher, petrol or gas-powered car sales were down 21.9% for the first few months of the year. The true test of Tesla sales and registrations will be results from the month of March, when the refreshed Model Y went on sale. Investors will get some insight into those numbers when Tesla reports first quarter deliveries next week. ",negative,negative,negative,neutral,negative
"Investors are betting on new Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan to turn around the troubled chipmaker. While it's unclear whether Intel's financial problems can be fixed quickly, Wall Street analysts — and current and former employees — generally agree on what steps Tan needs to take, short of a breakup. Those steps include everything from cutting jobs to turbocharging Intel's young foundry business. A semiconductor industry veteran, Tan was appointed to his new role on March 12. Investors applauded the news: Intel stock rose more than 15% the next day. Analysts liked Tan's experience as former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a semiconductor design software company, and his experience on boards of some 14 semiconductor companies, including Intel.Now the hard part. Tan is inheriting a company whose financial losses have made it a takeover target in recent months. Many Wall Street analysts and investors believe Intel — which is the only American leading-edge chip manufacturer — would be better off splitting up and selling its struggling manufacturing business. Case in point: The stock has risen on various reports in recent months of potential deals, some of which were allegedly being worked on with the support of the Trump administration. Reuters reported last week that Tan plans to keep Intel's manufacturing business running for now and is looking to bolster Intel's faltering AI chip efforts to catch up to Nvidia (NVDA). He said as much in a letter to employees on March 12: Together, we will work hard to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before. Read more about Intel's stock moves and today's market action. Yahoo Finance interviewed four Wall Street analysts and nine current and former Intel employees — including high-level executives. The employees were granted anonymity due to nondisclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. Some of those sources said Intel should be left in one piece, at least for now. That's because, if split up, Intel's foundry would immediately go bankrupt, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance. And Intel's product business, which designs the chips, can't outsource to rival manufacturers so easily — Intel semiconductors are specifically made in accordance with its own internal manufacturing processes. Not to mention, Intel's billions in CHIPS Act funding requires it to retain majority ownership of its foundry. Intel declined to make Lip-Bu Tan available for an interview but told Yahoo Finance: Lip-Bu is spending a lot of time listening to customers and employees as he comes on board and works closely with our leadership team to position the business for future success. Here's what company sources and Wall Street analysts said he has to do to to avoid a break up. 1. More business to the foundry Intel is one of the few remaining chipmakers that both designs and makes its own chips. On the design side, Intel has fallen behind rivals such as AMD (AMD) and, of course, Nvidia in an increasingly AI-dominated industry. On the manufacturing side, Intel has repeatedly faced delays.Former CEO Pat Gelsinger attempted to grow Intel's revenue by opening its in-house manufacturing business — a foundry — to outside customers on a large scale. Foundries such as Taiwan's TSMC (TSM) produce chips for other companies. Intel historically produced chips for its internal product business before Gelsinger launched Intel Foundry Services (IFS) in 2021. The foundry strategy had mixed results. Intel is set to achieve a big feat by launching a new advanced chip manufacturing process called 18A this year, and IFS has deals with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). But analysts debate whether Intel can sustain the foundry, which lost 3.4 billion on 7.5 billion in revenue in 2024. Bottom line: Intel needs to attract more big outside customers. Analysts and former executives said Tan's industry connections should help, but his credibility alone won't guarantee success. In order for Intel's manufacturing business to survive, the company must succeed in launching 18A. While Intel manufacturing employees had previously suggested that the new technology was having trouble, those same employees said this week that 18A is progressing — and Intel manufacturing staff is feeling positive about its success. As Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said: [I]f the results are good and companies are happy, they'll increase their capacity at the foundry. 2. Be patient and 'learn from deploying' Per Reuters, Tan is looking to boost Intel's AI chip efforts to rival Nvidia and others. Intel fumbled multiple attempts to enter what would become the AI chip market. In 2009, Intel scrapped a multiyear project, Larrabee, to develop a standalone GPU like Nvidia's. In 2017, Intel hired AMD's graphics chip engineer, Raja Koduri, to lead a second effort toward a homegrown GPU, which ultimately failed. And in January Intel effectively killed its most recent effort, a high-end AI GPU called Falcon Shores.Intel has a very good finance organization, but the company does sometimes make these decisions that are overly led by the early years' financial outcome, said a former high-level executive. You only learn from deploying. If you intend to be in that market long term, you might as well have access to the market, even if it costs you through the first generation. 3. Revitalize 'Team Blue'? Former and current Intel employees describe the company, whose staffers refer to themselves as Team Blue, as slow and bureaucratic. Past high-level executives said the chipmaker's new CEO will need to shake up company culture and cut middle management. It's a tough balancing act. The two current employees said any layoffs could depress morale and risk slowing the progress of 18A. Tan already has said Intel has hard decisions ahead. One of the employees said their colleagues are bracing for a potentially huge amount of layoffs in the second or third quarter. They said their teams are already understaffed, and cuts to middle management would result in those teams being moved around, creating chaos. One of the high-level former executives said, The depth of talent at Intel is immense, and the loyalty that people have is astounding, later adding, The answer lies in inspiring the people you have.",positive,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral
"GameStop (GME) stock rose more than 6% in after-hours trading on Tuesday as the company approved a plan to buy bitcoin (BTC-USD) with its cash holdings. The video game operator turned popular meme stock said in a release on Tuesday its board has unanimously approved an update to its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The announcement comes about a month after CNBC reported GameStop was exploring cryptocurrency investments. On Feb. 8, a social media post from GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen sparked speculation over GameStop's interest in cryptocurrency. Cohen posted a picture on X with Strategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor, who has famously hitched his company to bitcoin. It now holds more than 447,000 tokens, per a February filing.The strategy has worked out well for Saylor's company, with the stock up over 84% in the past year amid a rise in the price of bitcoin. But Wall Street strategists are hesitant to conclude that GameStop investing in bitcoin would mean the stock of the video game retailer has upside. The companys strategy, which has changed about six times in three years, is theyre going to buy cryptocurrency and be just like MicroStrategy, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance on Monday ahead of the earnings release. He added, The problem with that thinking is MicroStrategy trades at about two times their bitcoin holdings. If GameStop were to buy all bitcoin with their .6 billion in cash and trade at two times [their bitcoin holdings,] the stock would drop five bucks. Also after the bell on Tuesday, GameStop reported fourth quarter earnings results. The company posted .28 billion in net sales for the quarter, marking a 28% decline from the year-earlier period.

"(Reuters) - Canada has frozen all rebate payments for Tesla and banned the electric-vehicle maker from future EV rebate programs, Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday. No rebate payments will be made until each claim is individually investigated and determined to be valid, Freeland said in an emailed statement shared by her office. Freeland also directed the transport department to revise eligibility requirements for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles are not eligible as long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada. Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed a slew of new tariffs, with the bulk due in early April, in the form of steep 25% taxes on most goods from Canada and Mexico. Trump on Monday said automobile tariffs are coming soon, although not all of his threatened levies would be enforced on April 2. Canada has frozen C3 million (0.11 million) of rebate payments for Tesla. The order to stop the payments came before Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a general election on April 28, according to the Toronto Star, which reported the news earlier. The Star reported earlier this month that Tesla filed an extraordinary number of EV rebate claims in the final days of the program in January, with a single Tesla dealership in Quebec City claiming nearly C0 million in public subsidies by documenting more than 4,000 electric vehicle sales over a single weekend. Toronto stopped providing financial incentives for Tesla vehicles purchased as taxis or ride shares because of trade tensions with the U.S. earlier this month.

"(Bloomberg) -- The heads of some of the world’s top energy traders said they would be open to returning to Russia for business if sanctions were fully lifted, although some expressed caution about the prospect happening any time soon.If sanctions are eased in a way that we can go back in, why wouldn’t we? It’s our job. Gunvor Group CEO Torbjörn Törnqvist said in an interview. We don’t do anything today because we think even though there are some gray zones, we just don’t do it. But if these are removed, why wouldn’t we? Big western commodity traders had significant businesses in Russia before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, through long-term deals with domestic producers and investments in key projects. The companies have spent the past three years pulling back from many of those contracts and partnerships, and largely stepped back from trading Russian oil and metals, as the US, Europe and UK targeted Russian exports, producers, traders, and banks with a growing web of sanctions. The comments at the FT Commodities Global Summit in Switzerland show how the industry is thinking about the implications of Donald Trump’s efforts to end the war. On Tuesday, the US said Russia and Ukraine agreed to a ceasefire in the Black Sea, even as the Kremlin said its involvement would depend on a series of preconditions including sanctions relief. I think if the sanctions are lifted we would go back to Russia and see if we have a role to play in the commodities sector,Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. CEO Marco Dunand said. As a company we are bit more shy when it comes to sanctions, but if sanctions were lifted we would absolutely consider if we could bring value and go back. In markets from gas to aluminum, investors have been gaming out the possibility of a ramp up of Russian flows to Europe that could cause prices to drop sharply. But the trading house executives warned that both the process of reaching a peace deal, and the return of Russian commodities after that, could take longer than markets are anticipating. Trafigura Group CEO Richard Holtum said his company’s large cohort of British employees would complicate a return if US sanctions were lifted while other restrictions remained.You would need to see a wholesale winding back of all the sanctions before it’s something that could even be considered, he said. Russell Hardy of Vitol Group said his firm’s activity was obviously going to depend on the rules and regulations at the time, but cautioned that the process of negotiating a ceasefire was incredibly complex. In reality we do think it’s going to be a year or two, so there isn’t any anxiousness inside of the organization about being ready or preparing for it, he said. But clearly I could be wrong and it could be quicker than anticipated.",neutral,negative,neutral,negative,neutral
"Donald Trump's pick to lead the Social Security administration called improving customer service a mission critical function Tuesday and said the ability to have checks out on time is job one after early Trump administration actions undermined or raised questions on both fronts. Fundamentally, Social Security is a payment-based customer-facing program, said Trump nominee Frank Bisignano in his opening remarks before Senate lawmakers Tuesday, promising we will meet beneficiaries where they want to be met. The hearing came as a flood of headlines showed how Elon Musk-led DOGE cuts at the Social Security administration have already led to longer wait times as both phone operators and field offices are cut. Another change would curtail certain phone services within a matter of weeks. The developments are roiling an agency that pays out .6 trillion in benefits annually to 69 million Americans. The situation even got some Republicans up in arms Tuesday, with GOP Sen. Steve Daines playing from his phone the D-grade elevator music that awaits many recipients these days during waits that he noted can last more than an hour and end with a disconnection. We have a lot of work to do, the Montana senator added.Bisignano, a longtime Wall Street fixture who worked for Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and currently is CEO of payments giant Fiserv (FI), responded to the bipartisan questioning Tuesday by leaning on his private sector experience and calling himself an expert in both efficiency and customer service. I have experience at this inside and out, he said as the hearing began to wrap up after repeatedly promising that Trump's mandate to him was for no cuts to benefits. Bisignano also faced questions from Democrats on potential privatization of the agency, saying I have never thought about privatizing. He didn't give an opinion about whether it would be a good idea but offered a guarantee that he would not seek privatization if he is confirmed. Leading Democrats nonetheless charged that privatization is a possibility, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts saying that Trump's actions so far could lead to benefit cuts or increased privatization through backdoor ways to accomplish the same thing.A question of continued check delivery A larger concern voiced by many — including the man Bisignano is aiming to replace — is that Trump and Musk's rapid-fire moves through the Social Security system could be so disruptive as to lead to checks not being delivered. Martin O'Malley, who headed the agency during the Biden administration, has long charged that Musk's actions could lead to a benefit interruption. He added to reporters on Monday that they are breaking the agency by cutting staff. He contended that the larger goal is to turn Americans against the social safety net program because in order to rob it, they first have to wreck it. Bisignano rejected the characterization during Tuesday's back-and-forth. My job is to ensure that every beneficiary receives their payments on time, he said at one point and also offered some criticisms of current layoffs. Under questioning by Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Bisignano acknowledged, Do I think it's a great idea to lay off half of the employees when half the system doesn't work? I think the answer is probably no. Bisignano, who has previously called himself fundamentally a DOGE person, also said he would be willing to reverse decisions made by Musk's team. The nominee on Tuesday also sought to distance himself from Trump's and Musk's often repeated claims, as Trump put it before Congress recently, that they are identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program. The nominee on Tuesday instead repeatedly referred to a report from the Social Security internal watchdog that found fraudulent payments amounted to somewhere under 1% of total benefits paid from 2015 to 2022. He said that figure — which totaled nearly 2 billion in improper payments during that stretch — is much too high and lessening those improper payments is a top priority. It was part of a message where, again and again, Bisignano presented a plan to lead as a technocrat of sorts if he is confirmed. Asked about the fraud at one point, he offered, We will do all that root cause analysis, we will do all the process engineering and everything that's required to get to how to eliminate [the fraud].",negative,negative,negative,negative,neutral
"Sellers will have an option to delay broadly marketing their homes on popular websites.The National Association of Realtors unveiled a new policy designed to settle a long-simmering fight over how new home listings are marketed by giving sellers more flexibility in the process. The policy — a compromise to an industry dispute over semi-secret home listings — leaves rules requiring agents to list homes on shared databases known as multiple listings services (MLS) intact but adds an option for sellers to delay broadly advertising their homes online for some time. The exact timeframe will be set by individual MLSs. In practice, most real estate agents and listings websites that are members of the MLS like Zillow and Redfin will have access to the full slate of listings, but some homes may not immediately be viewable to the public on other data feeds. Sellers who opt for these delayed marketing exempt listings must sign a disclosure saying they understand the risks of foregoing immediate public marketing of their homes. The exempt homes will still appear on the MLS and be visible to those who have access to the databases. These policy changes allow for greater choice for sellers in marketing their properties while considering buyers’ need to access information through MLSs, NAR President Kevin Sears said in a statement. The compromise comes amid a years-long fight over a requirement that agents list homes on the MLS within one business day of beginning to market the properties. That rule, known as the Clear Cooperation Policy, is designed to reduce what are known as off-market or pocket listings, where a home for sale is marketed semi-privately to small pools of potential buyers without being advertised widely on the MLS. Clear Cooperation has fierce supporters and detractors within the real estate industry. Fair housing advocates support the policy, as do some leaders of brokerages and online real estate platforms like Zillow, saying it aids transparency and helps sellers get higher prices for their homes. But other agents and brokerage executives oppose the strict listing requirement, arguing it limits seller choice.Pocket listings make up a small percentage of the overall market and are most common in high-end real estate. Celebrities are often keen on keeping a transaction low-profile, and some sellers want the option to test their listing prices without having the stigma of price cuts and growing days on market on a public posting. After facing litigation, the NAR began a months-long review of Clear Cooperation and consulted with MLS leaders, brokerages, agents, multicultural groups, and other industry experts to develop the new rule. The new policy, known as Multiple Listing Options for Sellers, is in effect immediately and must be implemented by Sept. 30. Clear Cooperation and individual MLS submission deadlines also remain in effect.",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
"Tesla CEO Elon Musk held an all-hands meeting last week, which helped reassure both employees and investors, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Despite being down 30% since the start of the year, Tesla stock rebounded Monday as Musk demonstrated he is back in charge, Ives said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is jumping back into action at Tesla and investors are taking notice. Tesla’s stock is down more than 30% year to date, but its fortune reversed this week as Musk refocused his attention on the lagging EV maker. The company’s stock shot up 12% on Monday and closed at 78.39, marking its best day since the November presidential election. As of Tuesday afternoon, Tesla stock was trading up 2.8% at 86. The stock surge comes after Musk held a rare all-hands meeting with Tesla employees last week, in which he told employees not to sell their shares and promised that everything would work out. What I’m here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting, Musk said, and we’re going to do things that no one I think has even dreamed of. With Musk squarely back at the helm, Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives said investors are changing their tone on Tesla. Musk stepped up last week with the all-hands meeting, and that sent a much needed positive signal to employees and investors, Ives told Fortune. The stock was way oversold and is bouncing as Musk is back in charge and trying to balance DOGE and Tesla. Following the all-hands meeting, which was live streamed, Wedbush analysts led by Ives praised the move, and said they expect Musk to take a small step back from DOGE over the coming months to focus on Tesla. As a leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has orchestrated thousands of layoffs and millions of dollars in cuts to try to streamline the federal budget. The White House claimed in February, however, Musk wasn’t in charge of the cost-cutting agency, nor was an employee of it. Still, Musk acknowledged in an interview earlier this month he was balancing his business and government obligations with great difficulty. Last week, Ives called on Musk to rededicate himself to Tesla, and longtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber called for Musk to step up or allow the company to find a suitable CEO to run the company. Apart from its lagging stock, Tesla has faced increased pressure from China’s BYD, which overtook Tesla Monday with annual sales of 07 billion, compared to Tesla’s 7.7 billion in annual revenue.Moreover, Musk’s recent political involvement has led to an uptick in peaceful protests as well as vandalism targeting Tesla vehicles and showrooms. President Donald Trump has called people vandalizing Tesla property terrorists, and on Monday the FBI created a task force to investigate recent Tesla vandalism. Ives previously cautioned against the brand damage which has been caused by Musk’s political moves, but he said support for the CEO seems to be building despite the disapproval. There is still a brand crisis tornado in motion, but we are seeing many flood Tesla dealerships rallying behind Musk with these protests building, Ives told Fortune.",positive,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral
"A federal judge overseeing plea deal negotiations between the Justice Department and Boeing (BA) has scrapped an order giving the parties more time to reach an agreement and instead ordered the giant jet maker to face a jury trial. The surprise development upends a long-running legal saga that Boeing hoped to end as it tries to show progress on several fronts more than one year after a door plug blew off a Boeing-made Alaska Airlines (ALK) 737 Max 9 jet. The order from US District Judge Reed O'Connor came one day after the Wall Street Journal reported that Boeing wanted President Trump's Justice Department officials to let it out of a guilty criminal plea agreement the jet maker reached with the Biden administration. In that 2024 agreement, Boeing admitted that its workers conspired to defraud aviation regulators before two fatal 737 Max 8 crashes killed 346 people in the past decade. O'Connor rejected the deal late last year in part because of its terms governing the selection and conditions for a corporate monitor tasked with protecting against future fraud. Boeing and the DOJ had been negotiating changes to that deal before an April 11 deadline set by the judge. But on Tuesday, O'Connor ripped up that deadline in favor of a trial later this year in Fort Worth, Texas. The Court hereby VACATES its April 11, 2025, deadline in its previous order and instead sets this case for trial on Monday, June 23, 2025, he wrote.Boeing said, [As] stated in the parties’ recent filings, Boeing and the Department of Justice continue to be engaged in good faith discussions regarding an appropriate resolution of this matter. Paul Cassell, an attorney for some of the plaintiffs’ families, said, We are pleased with today’s order. The families have waited more than four years for justice in this case. In light of today’s order, the families won’t have to wait any longer than June 23. Admitting guilt was meant to insulate Boeing from facing a criminal trial on the government's allegation that the jet maker misled Federal Aviation Administration officials before the 737 Max 8 crashes at the end of the last decade. Those allegations initially produced a deferred prosecution agreement reached in 2021, but last year the DOJ notified Boeing that it had breached the agreement after a door plug blew off a Boeing-made 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines.Avoiding a criminal conviction would be a major victory for the company. Such convictions can foreclose or suspend a company's right to contract with the federal government and frustrate its ability to secure loans, according to Eddie Jauregui, a white-collar defense attorney with Holland & Knight and former federal prosecutor. Those consequences have particular meaning for Boeing, which counts the federal government as its largest customer and also happens to be the country's largest exporter. Just last week, Boeing won a major contract to build a new F-47 jet fighter for the Pentagon.O'Connor on Tuesday in his surprise order set strict courtroom rules and a quick pace for deadlines leading up to the trial date in June. The parties are hereby put on notice that Judge O’Connor will take the bench promptly at the appointed time for each session without waiting until the clerk or courtroom security officer has called the roll or otherwise ascertained the presence of all necessary parties, a scheduling order filed Tuesday stated. If tardiness becomes a problem, appropriate fines will be imposed. O'Connor went on to instruct that court conferences between the lawyers and the judge, known as bench conferences, must be kept to a minimum. Counsel must state the legal bases for their objections without elaboration or argument, unless invited, the order said. The judge also put particular focus on the period for discovery during which the parties exchange information that can become evidence in the case. Absent a compelling excuse, the judge wrote, any evidence requested on time and not disclosed within a reasonable time before the trial will not be admitted in the case.",positive,neutral,negative,neutral,neutral
